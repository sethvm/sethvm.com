                        I'm a Systems Design Engineering (SYDE) undergrad at the University of Waterloo.
                        SYDE is a unique program that emphasizes the utilization of multi-disciplinary
                        approaches to tackling technological and socioeconomical problems we face today -
                        all with users at the forefront.

                        My endeavours in design revolve around the objective of
                        improving the quality of life for others.
                        I'm currently exploring the never-before-seen challenges being brought by
                        COVID-19 to our essential industries - my spaces of interest
                        include <strong>healthcare</strong>, <strong>e-commerce</strong> and <strong>tech</strong>.

                        Should you ever need to find me outside of school and work, there's a
                        good chance I'll be working on dynos at the bouldering gym,
                        standing in line to board the fastest roller coaster at the park
                        or hiking up a mountain somewhere. Occasionally, I enjoy diving head-first into
                        clouds - with a parachute strapped to my back, of course.

                        I also spend time keeping my pastry craft sharp. Lately, I've been working towards
                        perfecting my souffl√© texture.
