                    I'm a Systems Design Engineering (SYDE) undergrad at the University of Waterloo.
                    SYDE is a unique program that emphasizes the utilization of multi-disciplinary
                    approaches to tackling technological and socio-economic challenges we face today.

                    My endeavours in design revolve around improving the quality of life for others.
                    Most recently, I explored problem spaces within the commerce and healthcare sectors as well as
                    how they've been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    Should you ever need to find me outside of school and work, there's a
                    good chance I'll be working on dynos at the bouldering gym, amping up to hit
                    deadlifts in the weight room or hiking up a mountain somewhere. Occasionally,
                    I enjoy jumping out of aircraft - with a parachute strapped to my back, of course.

                    Having worked as a full-time baker prior to university, I spend time keeping my pastry craft sharp.
                    Lately, I've been working towards perfecting my souffl√© texture.
