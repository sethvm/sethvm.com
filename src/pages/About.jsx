                    I'm a Systems Design Engineering (SYDE) undergrad at the University of Waterloo.
                    SYDE is a unique program that emphasizes the utilization of multi-disciplinary
                    approaches to tackling technological and socioeconomical challenges we face today.

                <Paragraph>
                    My endeavours in design revolve around improving the quality of life for others. I'm
                    particularly interested in the overlap between technology and problem spaces involving&nbsp;
                    <strong>commerce</strong>, <strong>healthcare</strong> and <strong>community</strong>.

                    Should you ever need to find me outside of school and work, there's a
                    good chance I'll be working on dynos at the bouldering gym,
                    amping up to hit deadlifts in the weight room
                    or hiking up a mountain somewhere. Occasionally, I enjoy jumping out of
                    aircraft - with a parachute strapped to my back, of course.

                    Having worked full-time as a baker prior to university,
                    I also spend time keeping my pastry craft sharp. Lately, I've been working towards
                    perfecting my souffl√© texture.
