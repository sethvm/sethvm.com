                    <Paragraph>
                        I'm a Systems Design Engineering (SYDE) undergrad at the University of Waterloo.
                        SYDE is a unique program that emphasizes the utilization of multi-disciplinary
                        approaches to tackling technological and socioeconomical problems we face today -
                        all with users at the forefront. As a SYDE student, my work centers around examining
                        how we humans interact with the technology around us.

                        My endeavours in design revolve around the objective of
                        improving the quality of life for others.
                        I'm currently exploring the never-before-seen challenges being brought by
                        COVID-19 to our essential industries - my spaces of interest
                        include <strong>healthcare</strong>, <strong>e-commerce</strong> and <strong>tech</strong>.

                        Should you ever need to find me outside of school and work, there's a
                        good chance I'll be working on dynos at the bouldering gym,
                        amping up for deadlifts in the weight room,
                        or hiking up a mountain somewhere. Occasionally, I enjoy diving head-first into
                        clouds - with a parachute strapped to my back, of course.

                        Having worked full-time as a baker prior to university,
                        I also spend time keeping my pastry craft sharp. Lately, I've been working towards
                        perfecting my souffl√© texture.
